problem statement:solution for solving array which has All numbers occuring twice except one number which occurs once.

Approach 1:
           { 
              USING XOR benifit ==> The time complexity of this solution is O(n) and it requires O(1) extra space. 
           }
Approach 2:
          {
              Using Hashmap Benifit ==> time complexity is o(n), Drawback ==> space complexity is o(n).
          }
